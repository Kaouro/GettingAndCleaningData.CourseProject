GettingAndCleaningData.CourseProject
====================================
This project is the submission for the Course Project of the Coursera Course Getting and Cleaning Data.
The run_analysis.R file takes the training and test data from the dataset found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and combines the different files into one tidy datset.

Afterwards some variables are aggregated by subject and activity as requested in the course project.
The export of the data is not part of the analysis file.

The Code Book was adopted from the original data.
